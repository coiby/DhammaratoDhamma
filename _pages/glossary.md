        <dd>Mental attitude of dissatisfaction.</dd>

        <dt>Metta</dt>
        <dd>Mental attitude of friendliness. Metta is a result of correct practice of anapanasati and not a practice the buddha taught on it's own.</dd>

        <dt>Nibbāna</dt>
        <dd>Literally means 'to cool down'. In the time of the buddha nibbāna was an ordinary word to describe cooling down like we use it in modern english. For example; The soup is nibbāna enough to eat. The food has cooled down enough to eat. In the context of the teaching of the buddha it refers to cooling down of the mental defilement's through practicising anapanasati.</dd>

        <dt>Nirodha</dt>
        <dd>To stop, to cease, ending of.</dd>

        <dt>Pañña</dt>
        <dd>Wisdom or insight. When the mind becomes unified it becomes calm and clear enough to start seeing how we think ourselves into dissatisfaction. When we take the right effort to make a change to the wholesome over and over again, we start to see the escape to the wholesome. Seeing the escape is pañña.</dd>

        <dt>Pitī</dt>
        <dd>The feeling of succes. When we repeatedly make changes to the wholesome we start to see that 'I can really do this!'. This causes confidence to arise along with pleasant physical and mental feelings. Congratulating ourselves on making a change to the wholesome is especially beneficial in developing this feeling of succes.</dd>

        <dt>Samadhi</dt>
        <dd>Unification of mind. When the mind feels happy, successful and is free from hindrances it stops wanting anything. This causes the mind to calm down a lot making it very clear to see what is going on in the mind.</dd>

        <dt>Sangha</dt>
        <dd>The Buddhist community of monks, nuns, novices and lay people.</dd>

        <dt>Sila</dt>
        <dd>Moral conduct. How we behave ourselves impacts our mental wellbeing. The buddha set out a number of guidelines in the Patimokkha and Vinaya. These are meant to point out which actions are dangerous to our mental wellbeing. We should put especially close attention to how these actions affect us.</dd>

        <dt>Sukkha</dt>
        <dd>The opposite of dukkha. Sukkha is satisfaction which means that whenever we're in sukkha we do not have dukkha. In that moment you have nibbāna.</dd>
